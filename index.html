    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>As a dedicated IT foundation degree student with a passion for technology, I am ready to develop my skills and gain logical and realty
        experience in the field through a software engineering apprenticeship program. While I may not yet have direct experience in software
        development, my current studies have provided me with a solid foundation in computer principles and related subjects, including
        programming, database design, and systems development. I am a quick learner and am confident in my ability to apply these skills to
        real-world software development projects. With my upcoming enrollment in a part-time software engineering undergraduate program, I
        am committed to further developing my skills and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. I am excited to bring my
        enthusiasm and eagerness to learn to your team and to grow as a software developer with your company.
